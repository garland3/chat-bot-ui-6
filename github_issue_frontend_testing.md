# Implement Frontend JavaScript Testing

## Overview
Implement comprehensive testing for the frontend JavaScript and Alpine.js components following the guidelines outlined in `js-testing.md`.

## Background
The project currently has backend testing with pytest, but lacks frontend testing for the JavaScript modules and Alpine.js components. With the ongoing Phase 14 Alpine.js integration, we need robust frontend testing to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

## Objectives
1. Set up Vitest testing framework for JavaScript
2. Extract testable logic from DOM manipulation code
3. Implement unit tests for core frontend functionality
4. Establish testing patterns for Alpine.js components

## Reference Documentation
Please review `js-testing.md` for detailed testing strategies and best practices for vanilla JavaScript and Alpine.js testing.

## Tasks

### 1. Setup Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Install Vitest and jsdom as dev dependencies
- [ ] Configure `vite.config.js` for testing environment
- [ ] Create test directory structure under `static/tests/`
- [ ] Set up npm scripts for running tests

### 2. Extract and Test Core Logic
Based on current frontend code, extract and test:

- [ ] **Connection Management** (`static/js/connection.js`)
  - WebSocket connection logic
  - Connection state management
  - Retry mechanisms

- [ ] **API Service** (`static/js/api.js`)
  - HTTP request handling
  - Response processing
  - Error handling

- [ ] **State Management** (`static/js/state.js`)
  - Application state updates
  - Session management
  - UI state synchronization

- [ ] **UI Components** 
  - Chat message rendering
  - Toast notifications
  - Form validation

### 3. Alpine.js Testing
- [ ] Extract Alpine.js stores into testable modules
- [ ] Test store methods and state changes
- [ ] Mock Alpine.js dependencies for unit tests
- [ ] Test reactive component behavior

### 4. Testing Patterns
Implement the patterns from `js-testing.md`:

- [ ] **Validation Logic Testing**
  - Form validation functions
  - Input sanitization
  - Error message generation

- [ ] **Data Transformation Testing**
  - Message formatting
  - User input processing
  - Response parsing

- [ ] **API Call Testing**
  - Mock fetch requests
  - Test error scenarios
  - Verify request parameters

- [ ] **Business Logic Testing**
  - Chat session management
  - Tool selection logic
  - Model switching functionality

### 5. Integration with CI/CD
- [ ] Add frontend tests to GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Configure test coverage reporting
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks for frontend tests
- [ ] Document testing commands in README

## Expected Outcomes
- Fast, reliable frontend tests (< 100ms per test)
- High test coverage for core JavaScript functionality
- Testable, maintainable frontend code architecture
- Confidence in refactoring and adding new features
- Consistent testing patterns across the project

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All core JavaScript modules have unit tests
- [ ] Alpine.js components are testable and tested
- [ ] Tests run in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Test coverage > 80% for extracted logic
- [ ] Documentation updated with testing guidelines
- [ ] Zero flaky tests

## Priority
**High** - Essential for maintaining code quality during Phase 14 Alpine.js integration and future frontend development.
