# Current Planning Steps and Work Status

This document outlines my current understanding of the project's state and my immediate next steps.

## Overall Project Status

All planned implementation phases (Phase 1 through Phase 13) as outlined in `plan.md` have been addressed with initial code changes. This includes:

-   **Core Application Functionality**: Chat interface, tool integration, session management, UI enhancements, multi-LLM support, chat export, immediate WebSocket connection, UI configuration integration, and Docker configuration fixes.
-   **Testing**: Unit tests have been added for new features, and the existing test suite has been updated.
-   **CI/CD**: An initial GitHub Actions workflow has been set up for continuous integration and deployment, including testing, Docker image building, and vulnerability scanning.
-   **Infrastructure as Code**: Placeholder Docker Compose files for different environments have been created.

## Current State of Work

The CI/CD pipeline is now successfully passing all tests and building/pushing the Docker image.

## Next Steps (Todo List)

The project's implementation is now complete from my side, based on the current `plan.md`.

## Summary of Changes Made (Since Last Status Update)

-   **Implemented Phase 13**: Immediate WebSocket connection, UI configuration integration, and Docker configuration fixes.
-   **Added new unit test**: For the `/api/llm_configs` endpoint.
-   **Fixed `uv venv` issue in CI/CD**: Modified `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` to correctly set up the `uv` virtual environment.
-   **Updated `requirements.txt`**: Ensured all dependencies are correctly listed for `uv` to manage.
-   **Refactored `app/services/llm_config_manager.py`**: Improved LLM configuration loading and management.
-   **Enhanced `app/routers/chat.py`**: Implemented session persistence and conversation history.
-   **Modified `app/main.py`**: Integrated new middleware and routers, and fixed string injection for UI configuration.
-   **Added `system_prompt.md`**: Default system prompt for LLM interactions.
-   **Created `config/llms.yml`**: Multi-LLM configuration file.
-   **Updated `tests/`**: Added new tests and updated existing ones for new features.
-   **Modified `app/services/session_manager.py`**: Added WebSocket management methods and imported `WebSocket`.
-   **Updated `tests/test_websocket.py`**: Adjusted for new WebSocket endpoint and message format.
-   **Updated `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`**: Reflecting changes for multi-LLM and other features.
-   **Added `pytest-mock` to `requirements-dev.txt`**: Resolved `mocker` fixture not found error in CI.
-   **Initialized SQLite database in CI/CD**: Added a step to run `python data/init_db.py` before tests.
-   **Fixed Dockerfile base image**: Changed `python:3.12-slim-buster` to `python:3.12-slim`.
-   **Granted packages write permission**: Added `permissions: packages: write` to the `build-and-push-image` job in CI/CD.
-   **Explicitly added contents:read permission**: Added `permissions: contents: read` to the `build-and-push-image` job in CI/CD.

## Current Problem: Frontend JavaScript `TypeError`

**Problem Description**: A `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener')` is occurring in `static/app.js` when the script attempts to attach an event listener to a DOM element, specifically `attachBtn` (line 136). This indicates that the JavaScript is trying to access the element before it is fully available in the DOM.

**Steps Taken to Diagnose/Address**:
1.  **Initial Debugging**: Added granular `console.log` statements in `static/app.js` to confirm which element was `null`. The logs confirmed that `attachBtn` was indeed `null` at the point of the error.
2.  **Debug Panel Implementation**: Added a debug panel to `static/index.html` and `static/app.js` to facilitate easier capture of console output.
3.  **Timing Investigation**: Explored potential timing issues. Although `app.js` is loaded at the end of the `<body>` and `init()` is called on `DOMContentLoaded`, the error persists. This suggests a more subtle timing problem where the element might not be fully rendered or available even after `DOMContentLoaded` for some reason.
4.  **Attempted `window.onload`**: Tried wrapping the `init()` call within a `window.onload` event listener in `static/app.js` to ensure the *entire* page is loaded before script execution. However, this change was not correctly applied in the previous interaction.

**Resolution**: The issue was resolved by identifying that the JavaScript code was attempting to attach an event listener to a `micBtn` element that had been intentionally removed from the HTML but its references remained in the JavaScript code. Removed all `micBtn` references from `app.js` including the DOM element declaration and the event listener attachment, which eliminated the `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener')` error.
