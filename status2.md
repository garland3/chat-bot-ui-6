# Current Planning Steps and Work Status

This document outlines my current understanding of the project's state and my immediate next steps.

## Overall Project Status

All planned implementation phases (Phase 1 through Phase 12) as outlined in `plan.md` have been addressed with initial code changes. This includes:

-   **Core Application Functionality**: Chat interface, tool integration, session management, UI enhancements, multi-LLM support, and chat export.
-   **Testing**: Unit tests have been added for new features, and the existing test suite has been updated.
-   **CI/CD**: An initial GitHub Actions workflow has been set up for continuous integration and deployment, including testing, Docker image building, and vulnerability scanning.
-   **Infrastructure as Code**: Placeholder Docker Compose files for different environments have been created.

## Current State of Work

The CI/CD pipeline is now successfully passing all tests and building/pushing the Docker image.

## Next Steps (Todo List)

The project's implementation is now complete from my side, based on the current `plan.md`.
