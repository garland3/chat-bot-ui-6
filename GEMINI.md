Hello New Developer,

Thanks for your contribution and welcome to the team!

The main documentation for this is in the plan.md file and the status.md file. 

Some common mistakes to avoid are

1. adding new code instead of updating existing code
2. not following the existing code style. ... in particular the file length. 

If you get stuck for more than 8 iterations, please ask for help. At the point if you are stuck that is fine. no shame in asking for help. Write a detailed description of the problem, what you have tried and append to the status.md file.

3. Not running unit tests often to make sure there is no regression.
4. not creating new unit tests for new code.
5. You can access github to check on runners or issues with the github cli tool "gh" .

Before you say you are done all test must pass and no errors on the github actions page.

If you fixed an issue, then on github mark the issue as resolved and add a comment with the details of the fix. 


Good luck!

Bob, 
    Senior Developer
