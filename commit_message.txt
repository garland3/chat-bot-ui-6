fix: Resolve test failures related to system message and tool calling

This commit addresses the recent test failures by:
- Adjusting `test_chat_message_llm_enabled_streaming` and `test_conversation_persistence` to correctly account for the system message in the conversation history and LLM calls.
- Ensuring `test_chat_message_tool_call` correctly mocks the LLM responses for tool calls.
- Updating integration tests (`test_full_chat_interaction_with_user_lookup_tool` and `test_full_chat_interaction_with_sql_query_tool`) to correctly mock LLM responses that trigger tool calls, ensuring the LLM's behavior is as expected in the tests.
