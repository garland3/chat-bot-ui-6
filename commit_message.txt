feat: Implement initial frontend UI tests

Implemented basic frontend UI tests using Beautiful Soup to verify the presence and content of key UI elements in `static/index.html`.

- Added `tests/test_frontend_ui.py` with tests for:
  - App title
  - New chat button
  - Message input textarea
- Installed `bs4` (Beautiful Soup) as a dependency for these tests.

This addresses parts of the "Setup Testing Infrastructure" (creating test directory structure) and "UI Components" tasks in GitHub issue #3.
