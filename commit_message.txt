fix: Resolve UI data source loading issue

This commit addresses the UI issue where data sources were not populating the dropdown.

- **Backend Changes:**
  - Modified `app/routers/data.py` to remove the `/data` prefix from the `APIRouter` decorator.
  - Modified `app/main.py` to explicitly mount `data.router` with the `/api/data` prefix.

This ensures consistent and correct routing for data source endpoints, allowing the frontend to fetch them successfully.
