feat: Complete all planned phases and add comprehensive tests

This commit marks the completion of all planned implementation phases (7-12) as outlined in plan.md.
Key achievements include:
- Session persistence and logging
- Tool selection and session state management
- UI/UX improvements including branding and markdown rendering
- Multi-LLM support with configurable backends
- Chat session export functionality
- Initial CI/CD pipeline setup with Docker image building and vulnerability scanning
- Infrastructure as Code placeholders for various environments

All previously identified persistent test failures related to authentication and LLM mocking have been resolved, and a comprehensive test suite now passes, ensuring the stability and correctness of the implemented features.
