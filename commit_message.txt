feat: Add UI for selecting data sources

This commit introduces a user interface for selecting data sources in the chat application.

- **Frontend Changes:**
  - Added a new dropdown menu for data sources in `static/index.html`.
  - Modified `static/app.js` to:
    - Include `selectedDataSources` in the `AppState`.
    - Fetch available data sources from the backend (`/api/data/data-sources`).
    - Dynamically populate the data sources dropdown.
    - Update the `sendMessage` function to send selected data sources to the backend.
    - Add event listeners for data source selection.

- **Backend Changes:**
  - Modified `app/routers/chat.py` to:
    - Retrieve `selected_data_sources` from the incoming message payload.
    - Update the session with the selected data sources using `session_manager.update_session_data_sources`.
    - Inject selected data sources into the system prompt for the LLM.
  - Modified `app/services/session_manager.py` to:
    - Add `selected_data_sources` to the session initialization.
    - Implement `update_session_data_sources` to store selected data sources.
  - Ensured `app/routers/data.py` is correctly mounted at `/api/data` in `app/main.py`.

- **Test Updates:**
  - Corrected test paths in `tests/test_data.py` to reflect the `/api/data` prefix.

This feature allows users to specify which data sources the LLM should consider during a chat session, enhancing the contextual understanding of the AI.
