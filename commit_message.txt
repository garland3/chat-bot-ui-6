fix: Resolve Alpine.js connection status not updating from WebSocket

**Main Issue Fixed:**
- Connection status stuck on "Connecting..." despite WebSocket being connected
- Alpine.js component wasn't receiving state updates from global app state

**Connection Status Component Fixes:**
- Added polling mechanism to wait for window.app availability during initialization
- Enhanced state listener setup with proper cleanup and immediate state sync
- Added comprehensive debug logging to trace state flow
- Fixed timing issue where Alpine initialized before global app state was ready

**WebSocket Service Updates:**
- Removed DOM manipulation conflicts with Alpine.js components
- Fixed extra closing brace syntax error in updateConnectionStatus method
- Added fallback for legacy DOM elements while supporting Alpine reactivity

**State Management Debugging:**
- Added console logging to AppState.setConnected() and notifyStateChange()
- Added detailed logging to Alpine component state updates
- Enhanced visibility into listener registration and callback execution

**API Endpoint Fix:**
- Corrected data sources endpoint from '/api/data_sources' to '/api/data/data-sources'

**Expected Result:**
- Connection status should now update from "Connecting..." to "Connected" when WebSocket connects
- Alpine.js reactive UI working properly with global state synchronization
- Data sources dropdown should load successfully
