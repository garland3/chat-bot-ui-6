docs: Update frontend testing strategy in js-testing.md

Updated `js-testing.md` to reflect the new frontend testing strategy.

- **Phase 1:** Basic UI verification using Beautiful Soup (Python) for static HTML structure and text content, integrated with existing Pytest setup.
- **Phase 2:** Comprehensive end-to-end UI testing using Selenium, executed within a Docker container to ensure isolated, reproducible, and scalable testing.

This update clarifies the approach for frontend testing and addresses the initial setup for issue #3.
