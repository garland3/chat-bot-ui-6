# Playwright Hanging Issue - Solution

## Problem
Playwright tests were hanging indefinitely when run with pytest in the Docker container environment. The hanging occurred during browser initialization, specifically at `os.waitpid(expected_pid, 0)` in the subprocess management.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by **async event loop scope mismatches** in pytest-asyncio when using Playwright in a containerized environment. This is a known issue documented in the pytest-asyncio and Playwright communities.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated pytest.ini Configuration
```ini
[pytest]
addopts = -v --timeout=30
pythonpath = .
asyncio_mode = auto
asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = module
```

Key changes:
- Set `asyncio_mode = auto` for better async handling
- Set `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = module` to prevent event loop closure issues
- Increased timeout from 10s to 30s for container environment

### 2. Updated Test Decorators
Changed all Playwright async test decorators from:
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
```
to:
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio(loop_scope="module")
```

This ensures the async event loop is properly managed across tests and prevents premature closure that causes hanging.

### 3. Enhanced Browser Configuration
Updated `conftest.py` with container-optimized browser launch arguments:
- Added comprehensive Chrome flags for container environments
- Increased browser launch timeout to 60 seconds
- Properly configured browser environment variables
- Set appropriate fixture scopes to match event loop scope

## Files Modified
- `pytest.ini` - Added asyncio configuration
- `tests/test_alpine_components_missing.py` - Updated async decorator
- `tests/test_alpine_components_working.py` - Updated async decorator  
- `tests/test_frontend_playwright_simple.py` - Updated async decorators
- `conftest.py` - Enhanced browser fixture configuration

## Results
- Tests that previously hung indefinitely now complete in 10-15 seconds
- Browser initialization works reliably in the container environment
- Event loop management is properly handled across test runs

## Reference
This solution addresses the specific issue documented in:
- [pytest-asyncio GitHub Issues](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/issues)
- [Playwright Python Docker Documentation](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/ci)

The key insight was that Docker containers with pytest-asyncio require explicit event loop scope management to prevent subprocess handling deadlocks.
