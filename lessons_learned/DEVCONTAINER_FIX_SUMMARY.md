# Dev Container Build Fix Summary

## Problem
The dev container build was failing with the error:
```
failed to solve: failed to checksum file frontend/node_modules/.bin/esbuild: archive/tar: unknown file mode ?rwxr-xr-x
```

This is a common issue on Windows with WSL2 when Docker tries to include files with Unix permissions/symlinks that don't translate well to the Windows environment.

## Root Cause
The Docker build context was including:
1. `frontend/node_modules/` directory with symlinks and executable files
2. `test_results/` directory with files having problematic permissions
3. Other temporary directories and files with permission issues

## Solution
Updated `.dockerignore` file to exclude problematic directories and files:

### Added to .dockerignore:
- `frontend/node_modules` - Node.js dependencies with symlinks
- `node_modules` - Any other node_modules directories
- `test_results/` - Test output files with permission issues
- `logs/` - Log files
- `.venv/`, `venv/`, `env/`, `ENV/` - Python virtual environments
- Various temporary and cache directories

### Key Changes:
1. **Updated .dockerignore** - Added comprehensive exclusions for problematic files
2. **Cleaned Docker cache** - Removed all cached build layers with `docker system prune -f`
3. **Created rebuild script** - `rebuild-devcontainer.sh` for easy container rebuilds

## Results
- ✅ Build completed successfully in ~14 seconds
- ✅ Build context reduced from 100+ MB to 726 KB
- ✅ No more file permission errors
- ✅ Dev container should now work properly

## Files Modified
- `.dockerignore` - Added comprehensive exclusions
- `rebuild-devcontainer.sh` - New script for rebuilding containers

## Next Steps
You can now:
1. Try reopening the project in the dev container
2. Use the `rebuild-devcontainer.sh` script if you encounter similar issues in the future
3. The dev container should build and run without the previous permission errors

## Prevention
The updated `.dockerignore` file should prevent similar issues in the future by excluding:
- Node.js dependencies and build artifacts
- Python virtual environments
- Test results and log files
- Temporary and cache directories
- Any files that commonly have permission issues on Windows/WSL2
