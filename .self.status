## Current Status - Git Operations & CI/CD Monitoring

### What I Was Working On:
- Completing git operations as requested by user:
  - ✅ Secured API key in .env file (replaced with placeholder)
  - ✅ Added all changes with `git add -A`
  - ✅ Created 3-sentence commit about dynamic tool loading and environment-driven configuration
  - ✅ Merged phase15 branch into main (preferring current branch changes)
  - ⏳ Push to origin main - user handling this from host due to dev container SSH issues

### Current Branch State:
- On branch: main
- Ahead of origin/main by 12 commits
- Working tree clean
- All changes committed and merged

### Next Steps After Reboot:
1. User will push changes to origin main from host machine
2. Monitor CI/CD pipeline: Found .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml file
3. Check for any build/test failures in GitHub Actions
4. Restart development server if needed (user mentioned anthropic API issues earlier)

### Key Implementation Completed:
- Dynamic tool loading from /app/tools folder
- Configuration-driven chat name and LLM models via YAML
- Environment variable security for API keys
- All tests passing (5/5 test suites)
- Removed color configurations from config.py as requested

### Architecture Changes Made:
- Moved BaseTool from /app/tools/base_tool.py to /app/app/common/base_tool.py
- Created /app/app/services/tool_manager.py with dynamic tool discovery
- Updated /app/app/config.py to use python-dotenv and removed color settings
- Created /app/config/llms.yml with 7 LLM configurations
- Modified /app/app/services/llm_config_manager.py for YAML support
- Updated all API endpoints to use new dynamic structure

### Test Files Updated:
- /app/tests/test_dynamic_tool_loading.py - comprehensive tool loading tests
- Updated 17 backend tests, 31 API tests, 10 integration tests
- All test expectations aligned with new architecture

### Environment Variables:
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (secured with placeholder in .env)
- App name propagation from config.py to UI implemented
- python-dotenv loads /app/.env explicitly

### Files to Watch:
- .env file (API key security)
- /app/config/llms.yml (LLM configurations)
- /app/tools/ folder (dynamic tool loading)
- CI/CD workflow results

### Previous Issues Resolved:
- Fixed all test failures after architecture changes
- Resolved environment variable naming (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
- Fixed endpoint conflicts and data structure mismatches
- CSP and API 401 issues mentioned - may need dev server restart

### User's Original Request:
"make sure this config file is not commited with the api key. do git add -A, then wrie a 3 sentence commit. Then merge the current branch into main where you prefer the current branch "switch_npm". then push to origin. monitory the ci cd for problems."
